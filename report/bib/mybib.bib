abstract = {In this paper, an overlapping-resistant Internet of Things (IoT) solution for a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-based indoor tracking system (BLE-ITS) is presented. The BLE-ITS is a promising, inexpensive alternative to the well-known GPS. It can be used in human traffic analysis, such as indoor tourist facilities. Tourists or other customers are tagged by a unique MAC address assigned to a simple and energy-saving BLE beacon emitter. Their location is determined by a distributed and scalable network of popular Raspberry Pi microcomputers equipped with BLE and WiFi/Ethernet modules. Only simple triggered messages in the form of login records (LRs) are sent to a server, where the so-called path vectors (PVs) and interest profile (IPr) are set. The authors implemented the prototype and demonstrated its usefulness in a controlled environment. As it is shown in the paper, the solution is highly overlap-resistant and mitigates the so-called multilocation problem.},

abstract = {Current location or monitoring systems are a set of several technologies that allow you to monitor the movement of different people or objects in both indoor and outdoor areas. These include Global Position System, Radio-frequency identification, Near-Field Communication, Bluetooth Low Energy beacon, Video Surveillance Systems, Intruder and Hold-up Alarm Systems, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, QR codes, etc. All these technologies have their technical limits. Not every system is usable both in normal operating mode (e.g. attendance monitoring, logistics processes) and in mode triggered by an emergency or situation (e.g. due to the spread of an infectious disease such as COVID-19). A long-term research activity of the authors of the article is the development of a technical solution that would allow monitoring and tracing of persons or objects (entities), not only outdoors but also closed environments (e.g. with low level of GPS signal). This solution would also be usable in both normal and specific modes. One of the possible technical solutions is the iBeacon technology, which works on the principle of Bluetooth Low Energy and which, in addition to commercial applications, can also be used in the field of security and safety. The article focuses on determining the position of an entity in inner space using iBeacon technology, using various approaches, such as determining position by assigning distance to a specific level of RSSI signal, determining position based on the ratio of RSSI signal level of opposite sensors, or determining position based on the "fingerprinting" method.},

abstract = {The purpose of this research was to develop a simple, cost-effective, but enough efficient solution for locating, tracking and distribution analysis of people and/or vehicle flowing, based on non-intrusive Bluetooth sensing and selective filtering algorithms employing artificial intelligence components. The solution provides a tool for analyzing density of targets in a specific area, useful when checking contact proximities of a target along a route. The principle consists of the detection of mobile devices that use active Bluetooth connections, such as personal notebooks, smartphones, smartwatches, Bluetooth headphones, etc. to locate and track their movement in the dedicated area. For this purpose, a specific configuration of three BT sensors is used and RSSI levels compared, based on a combination of differential location estimates. The solution may also be suited for indoor localization where GPS signals are usually weak or missing; for example, in public places such as subway stations or trains, hospitals, airport terminals and so on. The applicability of this solution is estimated to be vast, ranging from travel and transport information services, route guidance, passenger flows tracking, and path recovery for persons suspected to have SARS-COV2 or other contagious viruses, serving epidemiologic enquiries. The specific configuration of Bluetooth detectors may be installed either in a fixed location, or in a public transport vehicle. A set of filters and algorithms for triangulation-based location of detected targets and movement tracking, based on artificial intelligence is employed. When applied in the public transport field, this setup can be also developed to extract additional information on traffic, such as private traffic flowing, or passenger movement patterns along the vehicle route, improved location in absence of GPS signals, etc. Field tests have been carried out for determining different aspects concerning indoor location accuracy, reliability, selection of targets and filtering. Results and possible applications are also presented in the final section of the paper.},

abstract = {Previous indoor positioning research has mainly been focused on using Wi-Fi and RFID. In recent years, researchers began to study using Bluetooth 4.0 and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for indoor positioning purposes. In general, positioning techniques based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI), such as signal propagation and fingerprint, are commonly used in wireless/mobile networks. These techniques have certain limitations and tradeoff in terms of accuracy, ease of implementation and practical application/deployment. For example, both methods require a training process before deployment. In this paper, we present a decentralized BLE-based positioning protocol that does not require training before deployment. The training process can automatically be done on the fly by the anchor nodes. While the anchor nodes are broadcasting, they also scan for signals emitted by other anchors. This collaborative communication process exchanges location information and signal strength measurements between each anchor. This process builds a signal-to-distance reference list for the target node to estimate physical distance in a more accurate way. Experimentation in a real indoor environment shows that the proposed collaborative positioning method can achieve an error of 1.5 meters on average. This is generally applicable for most indoor positioning applications for locating people. Furthermore, its implementation is simple and practical, because it does not require training before positioning estimation and is adaptive to environmental changes.},

abstract = {In recent years, rapid development in robotics, mobile, and communication technologies has encouraged many studies in the field of localization and navigation in indoor environments. An accurate localization system that can operate in an indoor environment has considerable practical value, because it can be built into autonomous mobile systems or a personal navigation system on a smartphone for guiding people through airports, shopping malls, museums and other public institutions, etc. Such a system would be particularly useful for blind people. Modern smartphones are equipped with numerous sensors (such as inertial sensors, cameras, and barometers) and communication modules (such as WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC, LTE/5G, and UWB capabilities), which enable the implementation of various localization algorithms, namely, visual localization, inertial navigation system, and radio localization. For the mapping of indoor environments and localization of autonomous mobile sysems, LIDAR sensors are also frequently used in addition to smartphone sensors. Visual localization and inertial navigation systems are sensitive to external disturbances; therefore, sensor fusion approaches can be used for the implementation of robust localization algorithms. These have to be optimized in order to be computationally efficient, which is essential for real-time processing and low energy consumption on a smartphone or robot.},

  abstract={While the Internet of Things (IoT) is driving a transformation of current society toward a smarter one, new challenges and opportunities have arisen to accommodate the demands of IoT development. Low power wireless devices are, undoubtedly, the most viable solution for diverse IoT use cases. Among such devices, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons have emerged as one of the most promising due to the ubiquity of Bluetooth-compatible devices, such as iPhones and Android smartphones. However, for BLE beacons to continue penetrating the IoT ecosystem in a holistic manner, interdisciplinary research is needed to ensure seamless integration. This paper consolidates the information on the state-of-the-art BLE beacon, from its application and deployment cases, hardware requirements, and casing design to its software and protocol design, and it delivers a timely review of the related research challenges. In particular, the BLE beacon's cutting-edge applications, the interoperability between packet profiles, the reliability of its signal detection and distance estimation methods, the sustainability of its low energy, and its deployment constraints are discussed to identify research opportunities and directions.},
